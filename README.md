# Store-Challenge!


Our e-commerce application is an online shopping platform designed to facilitate the purchasing experience of our users. The application is developed in Xcode using SwiftUI, following the MVVM architecture and employing TDD to ensure greater code quality and stability.

The application offers a wide variety of products from different categories that users can add to their shopping cart with just one click. Additionally, our application has a promotions system that allows users to take advantage of discounts on different products. Promotions include discounts on the purchase of a certain quantity of the same product, as well as "buy one, get one free" type offers.
